# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using
machine learning techniques. Movie metadata such as genres and descriptions
are processed to extract features, and cosine similarity is used to recommend
movies similar to a given input.

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, and
similarity-based recommendation using Python.

**Technologies used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
